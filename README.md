This project focuses on building a machine learning–based food classification system using nutritional information such as calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and sugar. The goal is to accurately predict the exact food name based on its nutritional profile, supporting strict diet-planning and health-focused applications. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, removing duplicates, treating outliers, and scaling features. Multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Gradient Boosting are trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The best-performing model is then used for real-time food prediction based on user-defined nutritional requirements, enabling automated, precise, and reliable diet planning.
