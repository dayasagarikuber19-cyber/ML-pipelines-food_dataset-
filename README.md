In this food dataset project,I used all nutrients( carbs, cholesterol, fats, proteins, water_level, sugar etc) to find a target ( which i created ) healthy or unhealthy . I did cleaning, preprocessing, encoding, scaling, EDA and then finally training and testing the model, and found out F1 score, Recall, precision and accuracy.The high-capacity models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost have very high training accuracy but slightly lower test accuracy, indicating mild overfitting. Simpler models like Logistic Regression and KNN show smaller gaps between train and test accuracy, suggesting better generalization but slightly lower overall accuracy. Overall, most models perform well, with the best balance between train and test accuracy seen ( from my results)
